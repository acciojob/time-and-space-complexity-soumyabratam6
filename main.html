	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on and makes more efficient</p>
	<p>When an algorithm is run on a computer, it necessitates a certain amount of memory space. The amount of memory used by a program to execute it is represented by its <b>Space Complexity</b> O(n)</p>
